Data analysis of UFC fights from 1993-2019

I've been working on a personal project doing data analysis and visualizations using UFC fight data from Novemer 12, 1993 - June 8, 2019. So far I've created these two heat maps that show the average strikes attempted and landed every 15 minutes per strike type, by weight class. The data was averaged over all the fights in each weight class. I also took into account the fact that fighters fight at different weight classes sometimes, e.g. Masvidal's fights at Lightweight and Welterweight only count towards the Ligweight and Welterweight averages, respectively. The first [plot](https://ibb.co/6nRJgT0) shows the strikes attempted, and the second [plot](https://ibb.co/jDGCRb9) shows the strikes landed.

Looking at the images you can see that, unsurprisingly, the lighter weight classes attempt and land more strikes than heavier classes. There are some other interesting things to note:

* Light heavyweights land more ground strikes on average than fighters in any other weight class

* Female fighters land more strikes on average than male fighters.

* Heavyweights don't like to throw leg kicks.

* Male Flyweights love to take people down.

* Female Strawweights are excellent fighters.
